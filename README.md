# Maze_generator üåê

A dynamic web-based application that programmatically generates unique mazes. Explore freshly created labyrinths right in your browser!

## About

The "Maze_generator" is a public repository created by dannz510. This project demonstrates an understanding of algorithms and web development, providing users with a visual tool to generate random mazes. It's a great example of how mathematical concepts can be brought to life through interactive web applications.

## Features

* **Dynamic Maze Generation:** Creates a new, unique maze each time.
* **Web-Based Interface:** Easily accessible through any modern web browser.
* **Visual Representation:** See the maze being generated and displayed visually.

---

## Technologies Used

* **SCSS (Sass):** Used for pre-processing CSS, allowing for more organized and powerful styling of the maze and interface.
* **HTML:** Provides the structural foundation of the web application.
* **JavaScript (via Babel):** Handles the core maze generation algorithms and interactive logic. (Note: `script.babel` suggests JavaScript is being transpiled, likely from a newer syntax to ensure broader browser compatibility).

---

## Files

The key files in this repository include:

* `index.html`: The main entry point for the web application.
* `script.babel`: Contains the JavaScript (or Babel-transpiled JavaScript) logic for maze generation.
* `style.scss`: The Sass stylesheet that compiles into CSS for styling the maze and surrounding elements.
* `LICENSE`: Details the project's MIT License.
* `README.md`: This very file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To view or run this maze generator locally, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dannz510/Maze_generator.git](https://github.com/dannz510/Maze_generator.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Maze_generator
    ```
3.  **Open the application:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. Since SCSS is used, you might need a local development server or a build process to compile `style.scss` to `style.css` if it's not already compiled and included directly by the HTML. If the `index.html` directly links to `style.scss`, ensure your browser or environment supports SCSS, or compile it first.
